To run the code, download or clone the repo.

To run part 1 cd into the part1 folder and then run the command `npm i`

Do the same for part 2

To run the code for part 1 type `node part1.js` and for part 2 `node part2.js`

Make sure you are in the proper folder when running each subsequent js file.

Thanks
